Run all your services with one command, watch their logs live, start and stop individually or all at once. Works with a single project or a whole workspace.

## Features

- **One config file per project** — just ask an agent to write a `launch.yml` file for your project, the syntax is given below; run `launch` from the workspace root and it scans subdirectories automatically;
- **Multi-project sidebar** — services grouped by project, collapse/expand projects;
- **Live log streaming** — per-process log pane, persists across restarts;
- **Process persistence** — detach and reattach later with keeping the processes running, or exit and kill all;
- **Dependency ordering** — start services in the right order, across multiple projects;
- **Health checks** — holds dependents until a service is actually up;
- **Taskfile support** — runs tasks from a `Taskfile.yml` alongside processes;

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamarutyunov/launch.git ~/launch
cd ~/launch && go build -o launch .
```

Add to your PATH:

```bash
# .zshrc / .bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/launch:$PATH"

# config.fish
fish_add_path ~/launch
```

## Usage

```bash
launch              # current directory
launch ~/projects   # discovers launch.yml in subdirectories
```

## Config

Drop a `launch.yml` in your project directory, for example:

```yaml
name: backend

processes:
  postgres:
    title: PostgreSQL
    command: docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 postgres:16
    auto_start: true
    ready_check:
      command: pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1
      interval: 2s
      retries: 15

  api:
    title: API Server
    command: go run ./cmd/api
    auto_start: true
    depends_on:
      - postgres
```

### depends_on

```yaml

```

### Taskfile integration

Drop a `Taskfile.yml` next to `launch.yml` and its tasks appear in the sidebar automatically.
